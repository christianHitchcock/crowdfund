- Mobile-first workflow
- [jquery](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://sass-lang.com) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first time working with sass . a CSS preprocessor which made my work much more easier . and i also worked with jquery making it easier to toggle the menu and buttons. i learned so much here . after working i tried testing my html code and i figured some errors which i will avoid in my next challenge . errors like a ul can not have a div as a child element . etc 
i wrote most of the js code independent thinking out ways to solve various problems .and eventually solving it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
   <li class="logo"><img src="images/logo.svg" alt="logo" > </li>
        <div class="items" id="myTopnav">
        <li><a href="#"> About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" > Discover</a></li>
        <li><a href="#"> Get Started </a></li> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="menu-icons">
          <img src="images/icon-hamburger.svg" alt="openmenu" id="openmenu" onclick="toggleMenu()">
          <img src="images/icon-close-menu.svg" alt="closemenu" id="closemenu" onclick="toggleMenu()">
        </div>
      </ul>
```


### Continued development

javascript, css and html still needs improvement . with continues pratice i will get there .
